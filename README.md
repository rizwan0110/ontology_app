# ontology_app
Exploring Germany â€“ A semantic tourism guide.

Semantic technologies have many advantages that includes improved data availability and better knowledge management. The aim of this project is to develop a tourism website that highlights Germany, an amazing tourist destination by utilising the knowledge representation, semantic web technologies and ontologies.

The tourism website application which we developed for promoting travel in Germany is designed to provide users with information about various attractions, destinations, and regions within the country. The application uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end, Flask for the back end and SPARQL for data retrieval. The ontological structure is defined using RDF and OWL offering a comprehensive representation of tourism related entities.

## To run the application 

The perquisite to run the application is that there should be python interpreter installed in the system as the program is written in Python. Then Install the required package from the terminal of the code compiler.

Command to install the packages

pip install Flask

pip install rdflib
